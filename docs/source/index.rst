Welcome to Data Modelling with PostgreSQL's documentation!
==========================================================

This is the capstone project from the `Udacity <https://www.youtube.com/embed/2i9k3dgVLp0>`_ Nanodegree to build an ETL pipeline.
To complete the project, we created fact and dimension tables for a star schema and 
write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from JSON files into these tables in Postgres
using Python and SQL.

Please :ref:`contact me<contact>` if you need more information.
